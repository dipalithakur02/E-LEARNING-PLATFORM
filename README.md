*DESCRIPTION*: The task involves designing and developing the front-end of an e-learning platform with a focus on creating a user-friendly, interactive, and visually appealing multi-page interface. The platform will feature a comprehensive course listing system that allows users to browse available courses with filtering options by category, difficulty level, or keywords, presented in an organized grid or card-based layout with essential details such as course titles, instructors, ratings, durations, and pricing. A critical component will be the progress tracking functionality, enabling learners to monitor their advancement through courses via visual indicators like progress bars, completion percentages, and achievement badges, along with detailed statistics on time spent, lessons completed, and overall performance. The platform will also incorporate seamless video embedding capabilities, allowing for high-quality playback of course content with standard controls, interactive transcripts, and adjustable playback speeds, while ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes. The interface will include a dedicated dashboard where users can view their enrolled courses, track learning milestones, receive personalized recommendations, and access certificates or badges upon course completion. Additional features will consist of a responsive navigation system, user authentication interfaces (login/signup), instructor profiles, rating and review sections, and a search functionality to enhance discoverability. The design must prioritize responsiveness, ensuring optimal performance and usability across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices through flexible layouts, adaptive images, and touch-friendly interactions. The deliverables will include a fully styled and interactive multi-page interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a cohesive color scheme, consistent typography, and intuitive UI elements such as buttons, modals, and tooltips. The front-end will be developed with a focus on accessibility, performance optimization, and cross-browser compatibility, while adhering to modern web standards and best practices. The final product should provide a seamless and engaging learning experience, combining aesthetic appeal with functional robustness to facilitate easy navigation, course discovery, and progress management for users of all technical proficiencies. Optional enhancements may include dark mode support, animated transitions, downloadable resources, and social sharing features to further enrich the user experience. This project will serve as a demonstration of front-end development skills, emphasizing clean code, modular design, and the ability to create dynamic, data-driven interfaces for educational technology applications.
